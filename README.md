## 🌟 Conclusion

This repository captures not just my assignments and projects, but my entire learning journey in cybersecurity over two months at the Digisuraksha Parhari Foundation. Every folder and file reflects a step in my progress— from onboarding and foundational skills to red teaming, malware analysis, and a final project showcase.

This structure divides everything into logical phases: onboarding, month-wise weekly folders, projects, resources, attendance, and feedback.

The included conclusion ties together your growth and acknowledges those who helped along the way—a professional finish appropriate for your internship documentation.
